Ingredients
    6 ears corn
    1 tomato, finely chopped
    5 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, cut into small cubes
    1 orange bell pepper, finely chopped
    1/2 cucumber, finely chopped

    2 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro
    1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
    1 1/2 teaspoons coarse sea salt
    freshly cracked black pepper to taste
    1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste (optional) 

    
    Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
    Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add corn; cook until tender, about 6 minutes. Drain.
    Cook corn on the preheated grill until lightly golden, about 5 minutes. Cool until easily handled, 5 to 10 minutes.
    Cut corn kernels off the cob with a sharp knife. Transfer to a large bowl; add tomato, Monterey Jack cheese, orange bell pepper, cucumber, and cilantro. Stir in balsamic vinegar, sea salt, pepper, and garlic powder; mix to combine.
